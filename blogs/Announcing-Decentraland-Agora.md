## 使用 Decentraland 的新投票应用来帮助塑造虚拟现实的未来

Decentraland is first and foremost a community driven project. To empower community members to help make the decisions that will shape their Districts, and the entire metaverse, we've built [Decentraland Agora][3].

Decentraland 首先是一个社区驱动的项目。为了方便社区成员对小区和整个虚拟世界的成长做出决策，我们开发了[Decentraland Agora][3]。

Agora is a voting dApp that makes it possible for anyone who has contributed to a District to vote on issues related to that District. The Decentraland team will also use Agora to collect feedback from the community regarding other feature and user experience decisions related to the platform. All votes in Agora are cast as cryptographically signed messages, guaranteeing accurate results.

Agora 是一个投票 dApp，它使得任何拥有小区地块的人都可以就与该小区相关的问题进行投票。 Decentraland 团队还将使用 Agora 向社区收集有关该平台的其他功能和用户体验决策的反馈。 Agora 中的所有投票都是加密签名的消息，以保证结果的准确。

### What is&nbsp;Agora?

### 什么是 Agora？

Agora is an off-chain voting platform that allows users to vote on issues simply by submitting a cryptographically signed message.

Agora 是一个链下投票平台，用户可以通过提交加密签名信息就问题进行投票。

For any District poll that you vote in, the weight of your vote is determined by the amount of LAND that you contributed to the District. The more contributions you've made to a District, the higher your stake in the project, so your vote will be weighted more heavily.

对任何小区的投票，您的投票权重取决于您的 LAND 数量。您拥有的小区土地越多，则您在项目中的股份就越高，因此您的投票比重将更大。

In the future, the Decentraland team will solicit feedback from the community in the form of polls on Agora. Your vote in these polls will be weighted according to the amount of MANA you hold in your wallet.

在未来，Decentraland 团队将以 Agora 投票的形式征求社区的反馈意见。您的投票权重将依据您钱包中持有的 MANA 数量。

Agora provides a list of results, in real time, for each open poll, along with a list of the address that voted and their voting power.

Agora 为每次公开投票实时提供结果列表，以及投票地址列表和投票权重。

### Why did we build&nbsp;Agora?

### 为什么开发 Agora？

The first use case for Agora is Decentraland's community Districts. As the Districts moved forward in establishing their leadership teams, governance models, and startup plans, we saw a need for a secure and trustless voting platform that would allow District contributors to weigh in on these important, shared decisions.

Agora 的第一个用例是 Decentraland 中的小区。随着各小区在建立领导团队，治理模式和启动计划方面取得进展，我们看到需要一个安全且无需信任的投票平台，以便小区的贡献者能够影响这些重要的共享决策。

We also recognized that we needed a way to present questions and issues pertaining to the development of the Decentraland platform to the entire Decentraland community. We are very excited to start using Agora to gather feedback from our users that will ultimately help shape design decisions for the SDK and entire Decentraland experience.

我们还认识到，我们需要一种方法来向整个 Decentraland 社区提出
有关 Decentraland 平台发展的各种问题。我们非常高兴能够开始使用Agora 来收集用户的反馈意见，这最终有助于对 SDK 和整个 Decentraland 体验形成设计决策。

### How to use&nbsp;Agora

### 如何使用 Agora

To get started with Agora, simply navigate to [**agora.decentraland.org**][3]. Similarly to the [Marketplace][4], you will have to log into your wallet before being able to use the dApp. So, log into either Metamask, Mist, or your Ledger Nano S hardwallet.

要开始使用 Agora，只需打开[**agora.decentraland.org**] [3]网页。与[土地市场][4]类似，您必须先登录钱包才能使用 dApp。因此，请先登录 Metamask，Mist 或您的 Ledger Nano S 硬件钱包。

Make sure that you select the wallet address you used when you made your District contributions! The address you cast your vote from must be the same address associated with your LAND contributions.

确保选择您购买小区时使用的钱包地址！您投票的地址必须与您的 LAND 关联的地址相同。

Other polls posted by the Decentraland team require voters to hold MANA. Make sure that you select the wallet containing your MANA if you want to vote in a Decentraland poll. The weight of your vote is determined by the MANA balance in your active wallet at the time the poll closes. This means that if you transfer an amount of MANA out of your wallet **before the poll closes**, your vote will be reduced by that amount. Similarly, if you increase your wallet's ballance of the voting token before the poll closes, your vote will be weighted higher.

Decentraland 团队发布的其他投票要求持有 MANA。如果您想在Decentraland 中投票，请确保选择包含 MANA 的钱包。您的投票权重取决于投票结束时您的活动钱包中的 MANA 余额。这意味着如果您**在投票结束前**将一定数量的 MANA 从您的钱包中转出，您的投票权重将相应减少。同样，如果您在投票结束前增加了 MANA 余额，将增加您的投票权重。

To vote in a poll, select the poll that you are interested in from the list. From the poll's page, you will find the title of the poll, along with links to any relevant documentation, like a District Startup plan. You'll also see the number of:

投票时请从列表中选择您感兴趣的投票项目。在投票的页面中，您将找到投票的标题，以及相关文档的链接，例如小区启动计划。您还会看到以下数字：

* **Your Contributions** — the number of LAND contributions you have made to the District holding the poll. The weight of your vote is based on this number.

* **Your Contributions**  - 您持有的投票小区的地块数量。您的投票权重取决于此数字。
  
* **Total Voted** — the total number of contributions that have been voted.

* **Total Voted**  - 已投票的总投票数。
  
* **Total Votes** — the total number of address that have voted.

* **Total Votes**  - 已投票的地址总数。
  
* **Time Left** — the amount of time remaining before the vote as ended.

* **Time Left**  - 投票结束前的剩余的时间。

You'll also find a progress bar illustrating the real-time results of the poll, and a list of all addresses that have voted so far.

您还可以看到一个进度条，它显示了投票的实时结果，以及到目前为止已投票的所有地址列表。

To vote in the poll, simply click **Cast Your Vote**, select the option you would like to vote in favor of, and click **Vote Now**. If you don't have any contributions, then you won't be able to vote in the poll. Don't forget, your vote is not final until the poll closes! You can always return and change your vote as long as the poll is open. Once the poll has ended, your vote is final.

投票时只需点击**Cast Your Vote**，选择你想投票赞成的选项，然后点击**Vote Now**。如果您没有该小区地块，那么您将无法在投票中投票。不要忘了，在投票结束之前，你的投票并不是最终的！只要投票未结束，您就可以随时回来更改投票。投票结束后，您的投票才将是最终结果。
