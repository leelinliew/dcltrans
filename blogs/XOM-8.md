Picture a barren landscape littered with futuristic space debris. There are dozens of robots, all hard at work collecting scrap metal and spare parts, rushing against the clock to construct buildings, machines, and starships. This is the setting for **XOM-8: Scrapyard Escape**, our first-party game built for the Decentraland platform!

想象一下，在一片荒芜人烟的不毛之地，散落着未来的空间碎片。有几十个机器人，正在努力收集废金属和零件，争分夺秒地修建建筑物、机器和星际飞船。这就是** XOM-8：星际逃生 **游戏的设置，我们为 Decentraland 平台打造的第一方游戏！

### What is XOM-8?

### 什么是 XOM-8？

Scrapyard Escape is a team-cooperative strategy game focused on three warring factions of robots. At the beginning of each week-long match, players choose a faction to support, and then are tasked with collecting different materials scattered around the playspace — a group of Decentraland owned parcels. As each team gathers more resources and builds up their base, they progress toward the ultimate goal: manufacturing a starship to escape the surface of the planet.

《星际逃生》是一个团队合作策略游戏，专注于三大不同的作战派系机器人。在每为期一周的比赛开始时，玩家们选择所支持的派系，然后负责收集分散在游戏空间周围的不同材料 - 一组 Decentraland 上的土地。每个团队收集更多的资源并建立他们的基地，朝着他们最终目标前进：制造星际飞船，逃离所在的星球。

Scrapyard Escape will be available for anyone to play. The game will take place in separate matches lasting approximately one real-world week. Before the beginning of each match, interested players will have a 24 hour period when they can sign up and select their faction. Once the game begins, the factions compete against each other in a race to collect different resources that they then use to build factories, equipment, and warehouses to store even more resources. The ultimate objective is to return to their home planet by building a new starship.

任何人都可以玩《星际逃生》。游戏将在不同的比赛中进行，大约持续现实中的一周。在每场比赛开始之前，有兴趣的玩家们将有 24 小时的时间，用于注册并选择所支持的派系。一旦游戏开始，各派在竞赛中相互竞争，收集不同的资源，然后用它们建造工厂，设备和仓库，以便存储更多的资源。最终目标是通过建造一艘新的星际飞船返回他们的家园。

The winning teams will be awarded MANA from a pool that each player must contribute to in order to play. Players can also earn in-game assets like special buildings and machinery upgrades in the form of NFTs that can be reused in future matches.

获胜队将从每个玩家为参加游戏而贡献的奖池中获得 MANA。玩家还可以以 NFT 的形式赢得游戏中的资产，如特殊建筑和机械升级，并可在未来的比赛中重复使用。

Sounds like fun? We think so.

很好玩吧？我们这样认为。

### Wait, who's building XOM-8?

### 等等，谁在建造 XOM-8？

We are!

是我们！

Scrapyard Escape is a first-party game, meaning that the Decentraland team is designing and building it from scratch exclusively for the Decentraland platform. The concept was originally the brainchild of Chris Chapman (aka m3mnoch on Discord), Decentraland's Experience Architect, and he's already put a small team of people together to focus the project.

《星际逃生》是第一方游戏，意味着 Decentraland 团队正在为 Decentraland 平台进行专门设计和构建。这个概念最初是由 Chris Chapman（也就是 Discord 上的 m3mnoch），Decentraland 的体验架构师提出的，他已经把一小队人聚集在一起，专注于这个项目。

We're building Scrapyard Escape for two big reasons. First, it sounded like a lot of fun. Second, we want to help kick-start the creation of more community oriented blockchain-based games. **The entire project will be open-sourced to serve as a giant example, showcasing one approach to building complex, persistent, interactive experiences using our SDK.**

我们正在构建《星际逃生》有两个重要原因。首先，它听起来很有趣。其次，我们希望帮助更多以社区为导向的基于区块链游戏的启动。 **整个项目将是开源的，作为一个很好的例子，来展示使用我们的 SDK 构建复杂、持久、交互式体验的方法。**

We think that building Scrapyard Escape will both inspire other game developers to explore Decentraland as a platform and entertain existing gamers, in addition to providing us with valuable insights about what it's like to build games on top of Decentraland.

我们认为，构建《星际逃生》将不仅激励其他游戏开发者探索 Decentraland 平台，还将激励现有的游戏玩家，此外还能为我们提供有关在Decentraland 上开发游戏的宝贵经验。

### What does XOM-8 look like?

### XOM-8 是什么样的？

Every match begins with the Landfall Event. After players sign up and the game starts, a huge catastrophic battle begins to unfold in the skies above Decentraland. The players take the form of disabled XOM-8 robots, and can only watch as debris and slagged out starships from their factions begin raining down onto the surface of the planet, or Genesis City.

每场比赛都从登陆赛开始。在玩家注册并开始游戏之后，一场巨大的灾难性战斗将在 Decentraland 上空展开。玩家由残缺的 XOM-8 机器人的形式出现，只能眼睁睁地看着碎片和星际飞船从他们的派系中倾泻到星球表面，或创世纪城。

A ship from each faction eventually crashes down, containing a sentient Command Crystal. In a final effort, the Command Crystal reanimates the players' disabled XOM-8s, and provides them with instructions for the steps needed to rebuild their faction's ship.

每个派系中的星际飞船最终坠毁，包含一个有感知能力的 Command Crystal。在最后的努力中，Command Crystal 重新激活了玩家的 XOM-8 机器人，并向他们提供了重建他们的星际飞船所需步骤的说明。

At this point, the game officially begins and the players are able to move around the world.

此时，游戏正式开始，玩家可以在世界各地移动。

### What can players do?

### 玩家可以做些什么？

Each player takes the form of a XOM-8 robot belonging to one of three factions: The Foundry, The Reapers, and the P.I.P.s. Players then rush to scan the surface of the planet, looking for the fallen space debris and rare minerals that they can use to build up their team's base. All of these resources are shared among the factions, so each team must fight for the materials they need.

每个玩家都采用 XOM-8 机器人的形式，分别属于三大类之一：铸造厂、收割者和公共部门。然后玩家们急赴战场，对星球表面进行勘察，寻找坠落的空间碎片和稀有矿物，用来建立团队的基地。所有这些资源都在派系之间共享，因此每个团队必须为他们所需的资源战斗。

There are several different levels that teams progress through as they become richer in resources and more technically advanced. The teams level up by completing different tasks and objectives assigned to them by their Command Crystal, like building a warehouse to store more materials or constructing specific factories.

随着资源变得更加丰富，技术更先进，团队通过几个不同的级别升级。团队通过完成 Command Crystal 分配给他们的不同任务和目标升级，例如建立仓库以存储更多材料或构建特定工厂。

At any time during the game, players can return to their Command Crystal to check in on their team's progress and to get instructions for their next objective (players might even sneak into their enemy's base to spy on their Command Crystal). Accomplishing these different goals contributes to the team's final score, securing their position on the global scoreboard.

在游戏过程中的任何时候，玩家都可以返回他们的 Command Crystal 来检查他们团队的进度，并获得他们下一个目标的指示（玩家甚至可以潜入他们的敌人的基地来监视他们的 Command Crystal）。实现这些不同的目标有助于团队的最终得分，确保他们在全球记分牌上的地位。

While we are designing Scrapyard Escape to be a team-coop game, players can still play by themselves if none of their teammates are online. Since each match lasts and entire week, the teams who collaborate and coordinate the most are favored to win.

虽然我们将《星际逃生》设计为团队合作游戏，但如果他们的队友都不在线，玩家仍然可以单独比赛。由于每场比赛持续一整周，所以合作密切和协调统一的团队有望获胜。

A match ends with the first team to successfully build their starship. Once a match is over, the scores are tallied, and the arena is reset for the next round beginning after the 24 hour sign up period.

比赛由第一支成功建立星际飞船的队伍出现而结束。一旦比赛结束，比分将被计算，在24小时注册期后，下一轮比赛的场地重新设置。

### What can players win?

### 玩家能赢得什么？

In order to play Scrapyard Escape, players must stake a small amount of their own MANA. This MANA is pooled together and used to reward the highest placing teams, so everyone has the chance to earn a little extra (in similar games, developers could take a small cut of this pool as reimbursement).

为了玩《星际逃生》，玩家必须投入少量自己的 MANA。这些 MANA 汇集在一起​​，用于奖励最高排名的团队，所以每个人都有机会获得一点收益（在类似的游戏中，开发者可以取得这个奖池的一小部分作为奖励）。

There will be many additional awards in the form of tokenized in-game assets, like new characters, machinery upgrades, special buildings (and more) that players can save and reuse in future games.

另外将有许多额外奖励以游戏中的通证化资产形式出现，例如新角色​​，机械升级，特殊建筑（以及更多），玩家可以保存到以后的游戏中重复使用。

In addition to MANA and NFT awards, the highest ranking teams are recorded on a persistent leader-board, for all of Genesis City to admire.

除了 MANA 和 NFT 奖励之外，排名最高的团队还将会永久记录在排行榜上，让所有创世纪城景仰。
