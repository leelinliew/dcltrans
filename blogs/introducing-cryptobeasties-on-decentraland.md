The whole team here at Decentraland is eager to announce that we'll be collaborating with CryptoBeasties to build a Decentraland integration for their game, bringing your Beasties right into the metaverse!

### What is CryptoBeasties?

### CryptoBeasties 是什么？

![][5]

Trading cards have been a favorite with gamers for decades.

几十年来，卡牌游戏一直是游戏玩家的最爱。

There's something uniquely captivating and rewarding about seeking out and collecting rare items. Trading card games combined this classic pastime with the more social and competitive mechanics of a game. Many of us grew up with these kinds of games, like Pokemon, Digimon, and Magic cards, so we were all immediately excited to see how crypto would evolve the genre (pun intended).

寻找和收集稀有物品具有独特的吸引力和回报。卡牌游戏将这种经典的消遣与游戏的社会性和竞争机制相结合。我们中的许多人都是在这类游戏中长大的，比如口袋妖怪，数码宝贝和魔法卡片（Magic cards），所以我们都立即很高兴想知道加密技术会如何进化这种类型（双关语）。

The team behind CryptoBeasties was just as excited about the potential of crypto-collectibles, but they felt that the first crypto games were lacking the fun and engaging experience provided by real trading cards.

CryptoBeasties 背后的团队对加密收藏品的潜力感到激动，但他们认为最初加密游戏缺乏真正的交易卡提供的乐趣和引人入胜的体验。

They saw slow, clunky interfaces and a lack of immersion and interaction. So, they set to work building CryptoBeasties, a game still centered on collectibles, but far more social, more engaging, and (most importantly) more fun to play.

他们看到的是缓慢，笨重的界面，缺乏沉浸感和互动性。所以，他们开始构建 CryptoBeasties，游戏仍然以收藏品为中心，但更具社交性，更具吸引力，而且（最重要的是）玩起来更有趣。

### How does CryptoBeasties work?

### CryptoBeasties 如何运作？

CryptoBeasties is a blockchain-based trading card game (or TCG). This means that each card you add to your deck is owned by you and nobody else. The scarcity of digital items made possible by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) also means that your rare cards are actually rare (and more valuable).

CryptoBeasties 是一种基于区块链的卡牌游戏（TCG）。这意味着您添加的每张卡都归您而不是其他人所有。不可替代的通证（NFT）使得数字商品的稀缺性成为可能，也意味着您的稀有卡确实是稀有的（并且更有价值）。

We know that these attributes might not be new to people already familiar with other crypto-collectibles (but if they are, we highly recommend reading [our blogpost on how NFTs are changing online gaming][6]).

我们知道，对于已经熟悉其他加密收藏品的人来说，这些属性可能并不陌生（但如果是这样，我们强烈建议阅读[我们的关于 NFT 如何改变在线游戏的博客][6]）。

CryptoBeasties stands out with its easily accessible and immediately engaging game mechanics. CryptoBeasties is making it easier than ever to discover, acquire, and trade crypto-collectibles, building out your preferred deck.

CryptoBeasties 以其易于访问且引人入胜的游戏机制脱颖而出。 CryptoBeasties 比以往任何时候都更容易发现，获取和交易加密收藏品，更容易形成您喜欢的一副牌。

As you build a bigger deck of Beasties, you can form individual squads of three with complementary powers. The goal is to build the strongest squad that you can! These trios can then be pitted against other players' squads (or even an AI) to gain experience and strengthen your Beasties.

当你建造更多的 Beasties 卡牌时，你可以组成具有互补力量的三个小队。我们的目标是建立最强大的阵容！这些三人组可以与其他玩家的小队（甚至是AI）进行对抗，以获得经验并加强你的能力。

While a lot of other crypto TCGs allow you to customize your cards, **CryptoBeasties lets you give specific Beasties different combinations of skills and powers as they level up**. For example, Water Boars are normally super slow, defensive-minded Beasties, but if you add to his Speed skill every time he levels up and embed a Flying Attack "Power Stone", you might create the only superfast, flying Water Boar in the game!

虽然许多其他加密卡牌游戏 TCG 允许您自定义您的卡片，**CryptoBeasties 可让您在特定动物升级时为其提供不同的技能和力量组合**。例如，水牛通常超级慢，是具有防守意识的动物，但是如果你每次升级都加入一个速度技能并嵌入一块飞行攻击“力量石”，那么你可能在游戏中创造出一个唯一的超高速飞行水牛！

### What does this mean for Decentraland?

### 这对 Decentraland 来说意味着什么？

One of the biggest problems the CryptoBeasties team saw with most crypto-collectible games was a lack of immersive and social gameplay. While it's fun to collect and customize cute, digital creatures, they wanted to build a game that was more competitive, required more communication and collaboration, and provided room to grow.

CryptoBeasties 团队认为大多数加密收藏游戏最大问题之一是缺乏沉浸式体验和社交游戏。虽然收集和定制可爱的数字生物很有趣，但他们希望建立一个更具竞争力的游戏，需要更多的沟通和协作，并提供成长的空间。

We are extremely eager to help build an integration with Decentraland, making CryptoBeasties even more immersive.

我们非常渴望与 Decentraland 集成，使得 CryptoBeasties 更加身临其境。

Within the Decentraland Client, players will be able to get up-close and personal with their Beasties, making the battles that much more intense.

在 Decentraland 客户端中，玩家可以近距离接触他们的动物，使战斗更加激烈。

Decentraland also makes it possible to return to one of the biggest appeals of physical trading card games — spontaneous duels with your friends!

Decentraland 还能使现实中卡牌游戏的最大吸引力回归 - 与朋友对决！

You'll be able to carry your customized deck of Beasties with you wherever you go in Genesis City. If you see another person tagged as a CryptoBeasties player, you'll be able to run up and challenge them to a duel. Or, you could coordinate larger tournaments in one of the many locations of Genesis City.

在创世纪城中，无论去哪你都可以随身携带一幅定制的动物牌。如果你看到另一个标记为CryptoBeasties 的玩家，你可以跑过去和他们决斗。或者，您可以在创世纪城的许多地点举办更大型的锦标赛。

We've got a few ideas of what this might look like in-world: players may be teleported to a temporary, isolated "arena" either on a separate parcel or a platform floating in the sky. These arenas could be kept publicly available to spectators or friends of the players. Another option we're considering is limiting the public duels to roads and plazas. Since Decentraland is still under construction (and so is CryptoBeasties) we want to explore a few options to make sure that we deliver the best experience possible.

我们已经有了一些关于这个世界可能会是什么样子的想法：玩家可能被传送到一个临时的，孤立的“竞技场”，无论是在一个单独的地块还是漂浮在天空中的平台上。这些竞技场可以向观众或玩家的朋友公开。我们正在考虑的另一个选择是将公共决斗限制在道路和广场上。由于 Decentraland 仍在建设中（CryptoBeasties 也在建设中），我们希望探索一些选项，以确保我们提供最佳体验。
