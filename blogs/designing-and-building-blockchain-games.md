We've written in the past about [the different types of blockchain games][3] that we're really excited about, and we've talked about [the impact that NFTs will have on gaming][4], but we haven't yet compared blockchain games to the traditional games most people are familiar with.

在过去，我们已经写过让我们感到很兴奋的[不同类型的区块链游戏][3]，也谈过[NFT 对游戏的影响][4]，但我们还没有将区块链游戏与大多数人熟悉的传统游戏进行过比较。

So today, we want to introduce blockchain gaming in comparison with traditional gaming.

所以今天，我们来介绍下区块链游戏与传统游戏的对比。

If you're a gamer yourself, or you're a developer looking to get into blockchain gaming, we hope that this introduction helps to bring you up to speed on blockchain games and why we're so excited about them here at Decentraland.

如果你是游戏玩家，或者你是一个想要进入区块链游戏的开发者，我们希望这个介绍有助于加快你进入区块链游戏领域的速度，以及为什么在 Decentraland 我们对此感到如此兴奋。

### It all started with&nbsp;Bitcoin…

### 这一切都始于比特币......

We're all familiar with Bitcoin (the secure, transparent, and finite cryptocurrency) as the first use-case for blockchain technology that attained widespread, mainstream attention.

我们都熟悉比特币（安全、公开透明和总量有限的加密货币）作为区块链技术的第一个用例，它获得了主流广泛的关注。

Not long after Bitcoin, Ethereum was developed as a way to decentralize applications through the use of smart contracts: decentralized applications and scripts that can be run without having to trust a third party or centralized server.

在比特币之后不久，以太坊被开发为一种通过使用智能合约来使得应用程序去中心化的方式：去中心化的应用程序和脚本，无需信任第三方或中央服务器即可运行。

The next progression came in the form of the ERC20 standard built on top of Ethereum, standardizing fungible tokens. We then saw the appearance of CryptoPunks, a crypto-_collectible_ platform that allowed users to purchase different "punk" caricatures represented by something like ERC20 tokens.

下一步的进展是建立在以太坊之上的 ERC20 标准，标准化可替代通证。然后我们看到了 CryptoPunks(加密朋克) 的出现，这是一个加密 _收藏品_ 平台，允许用户购买由 ERC20 通证之类的东西代表的不同“朋克”漫画。

CryptoPunks are one of the first examples of blockchain tech in entertainment, and sparked the explosion of crypto-collectibles. Contemporary collectibles like CryptoKitties are represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning that each kitty is actually distinct, unique, and scarce — provably so thanks to a public registry built atop the Ethereum blockchain.

CryptoPunks 加密朋克是娱乐中区块链技术的第一个例子，并引发了加密收藏品的爆炸式增长。像 CryptoKitties（谜恋猫）这样的当代收藏品以不可替换（非同质）通证（NFT）为代表，这意味着每只小猫实际上都是独特的，不同的和稀缺的 - 通过以太坊区块链上建立的公共注册表，可以证明这一点。

Crypto-collectibles and the concept of digital economic scarcity have entirely shifted the way we view and value digital content, expanding a new avenue for online gaming.

加密收藏品和数字经济稀缺的概念完全改变了我们对数字内容的看法和价值，拓展了网络游戏的新途径。

**Last week, we talked all about the history of these tokens and their standards, so if you want to dive deeper, check out the post [****_What are NFTs?_**][5]** Otherwise, read on to learn more about blockchain _games_.**

**上周，我们谈论了这些通证的历史及其标准，所以如果你想深入了解，请查看[_什么是 NFT？_][5]**，否则请继续阅读以了解有关区块链游戏的更多信息。

### What are blockchain-based games?

### 什么是基于区块链的游戏？

To put it very simply, a blockchain game is any game that is built, even partially, on top of a public blockchain that enables each player to own and control their own data. This means that the game developer, or whoever is hosting and running the game, has to request permission from a player before they can write a new record to that player's database.

简而言之，区块链游戏是构建在或部分构建在公共区块链之上的游戏，每个玩家都能拥有并控制自己的数据。这意味着游戏开发者或任何托管和运行游戏的人必须先向玩家请求许可，然后才能将新记录写入该玩家的数据库。

Furthermore, since blockchains are essentially large, public databases, any developer from any location can access the player records stored on the blockchain. This adds a certain element of extensibility to blockchain games, because the content and data stored on a blockchain is more easily shared between different platforms and services.

此外，由于区块链本质上是大型的公共数据库，任何来自任何位置的开发人员都可以访问存储在区块链上的玩家记录。这为区块链游戏增加了一定的可扩展性元素，因为存储在区块链上的内容和数据更容易在不同平台和服务之间共享。

Imagine developing a marketplace where gamers can purchase new, unique skins (represented by NFTs) for their avatars in one game, to be built and maintained by a different developer in a completely different application. Not only do the players have complete, verifiable ownership of their new skin, but they can rest assured that their new skins are in fact scarce (or even completely unique).

想象一下，开发一个市场，玩家可以在这里购买某个游戏的新的、独特的装备（NFT），并可由不同的开发人员在完全不同的应用中构建和维护。玩家不仅拥有完整、可验证的装备所有权，而且他们也可确信，他们的装备事实上是稀缺的（甚至是完全独特的）。

This is in stark contrast to traditional online games where the databases of player and item records are stored in private, centrally controlled servers. These traditional games give the developers total control over player data, in addition to removing the potential for integrating truly scarce, digitally unique in-game items.

这与传统的在线游戏形成鲜明对比，在传统的在线游戏中，记录玩家和物品的数据库存储在私人的、集中控制的服务器中。这些传统游戏让开发者可以完全控制玩家数据，并同时也消除了实现真正稀缺的、数字上独一无二的游戏道具的可能性。

### Ok, what do blockchain games look&nbsp;like?

### 那么，区块链游戏看起来像什么？

We've already tried to define what a game can accomplish with the blockchain, but what are some actual examples?

我们已经尝试说明区块链游戏可以做什么，但是有哪些实际的例子呢？

Imagine taking one of your CryptoKitties (or [Etheremon][6] or [CryptoBeasties][7]) into an entirely different game or space where you can pit them against other peoples' kitties and monsters. Now, imagine translating your CryptoKitty's "cattributes" to a racing game, where these unique attributes are represented by your racecar and its performance. Maybe [maneuver][8] gives you a bonus to handling, and [hotrod][9] takes your top speed to another level.

想象一下，将你的 CryptoKitties 谜恋猫（或 [Etheremon 以太小怪兽][6] 或 [CryptoBeasties][7]）带入一个完全不同的游戏或空间，你可以用它们与其他人的小猫或怪物战斗。现在，想象一下将你的 CryptoKitty 上的“猫特性” 转换到赛车游戏，猫的这些独特的属性将由你的赛车及其性能来表示。也许[maneuver][8]给你个操作奖励，而[hotrod][9]将你的最高速度提升到另一个等级。

In addition to unique attributes attached to truly-owned virtual items, imagine if all of your MMO guild's management and resources were registered, stored, and tracked by a blockchain without the need to entrust that power to any single member. We are already seeing these decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) being applied to some very exciting and noble uses, lending true democracies more power and scalability.

除了附加到真正拥有的虚拟物品上的独特属性之外，想象一下如果您的在 MMO（大型多人在线游戏）协会上的管理和资源都由区块链进行注册、存储和监测，而无需将权力委托给任何单个成员。我们已经看到这些去中心化的自治组织（DAO）
被应用到一些让人非常令人兴奋和崇高的用途上，为真正的民主提供了更多的力量和可伸缩性。

These DAOs can be put to use in an incredibly wide variety of industries — like online gaming. By creating a DAO to run different gaming guild's you remove trust issues, guarantee and enforce accountability between players, and allow for secure and trustworthy records of titles, roles, and standards. **Imagine having one pseudo-anonymous game ID that you could share across multiple games, instead creating a different avatar and player name every time. Don't worry though, you could always create a fresh avatar as often as you want.**

这些去中心化的自治组织 DAO 可以在各行各业中使用 - 如在线游戏。通过创建 DAO 来运行不同的游戏公会，您可以消除信任问题，保证并加强玩家之间的责任，并允许安全、可靠的权益、角色和标准记录。 **想象一下，您可以在多个游戏中共享一个伪匿名游戏 ID，而不是每次都创建不同的头像和玩家名称。不过不用担心，你可以随时随地创建一个新的头像。**

Another exciting application of blockchains to gaming comes in the form of education and tutorials: picture querying a player's blockchain records, looking for similar games they've played in order to minimize the "time-to-fun metric" for your game. You can do things like hand out extra experience points, or maybe skip a tutorial, because you are able to confidently assume that the player understands the core concepts of your game.

区块链在游戏中的另一个令人兴奋的应用是以教育和教程的形式出现：想象一下，查询玩家的区块链记录，寻找他们玩过的类似游戏，以便最大限度地减少游戏的“找到乐趣时间”。你可以做一些事情，比如分发额外的经验值，或者可以跳过教程，因为你可以很自信地知道玩家理解游戏的核心概念。

Finally, picture a standard game achievement that is granted in the form of an NFT that the player can keep forever. Achievements, medals, and trophies are a huge draw for gaming, illustrating player goals and building up bragging rights in the community. Now, imagine creating a "team trophy case" containing the virtual equivalent of the stanley cup. Having your name engraved on a virtual trophy that will exist forever is a gamechanger. Winning players from each season can have their accomplishments displayed forever, free from the constraints of a centralized database belonging to a game company that might someday go out of business.

最后，玩家在普通游戏上的成绩可以用 NFT 形式授予，并可以永久保留。成就，奖牌和奖杯是游戏的一个巨大的吸引力，可以用来说明玩家的成绩，并可以成为在社区吹牛的权利。现在，想象一下创建一个“团队奖杯”，一个史坦利杯的虚拟等效物。将你的名字刻在一个永远存在的虚拟奖杯，这改变了游戏。每个赛季的获胜球员都可以永久地展示他们的成就，不受可能有一天会破产的游戏公司的集中式数据库的限制。

### How are blockchain games different from traditional games?

### 区块链游戏与传统游戏有何不同？

#### **Traditional Games**

#### **传统游戏**

* Assets are owned and controlled by the game developer

* 资产由游戏开发商拥有和控制
* Game assets are not transferable between games

* 游戏资产不能在游戏之间转移
* Player history is hard to track and share between games

* 玩家经历很难在游戏之间跟踪和分享

#### **Blockchain Games**

#### **区块链游戏**

* Assets are owned and controlled by the player

* 资产由玩家拥有和控制

* Blockchain game assets are interoperable across games

* 区块链游戏资产可以跨游戏互操作

* A continuous record of player and data history allows developers to create personalized content

* 具有连续地玩家记录和数据历史记录，允许开发人员创建个性化内容

Along with the many boons and new toys that game designers can play with, there are a few serious, implementation-affecting effects that blockchain game developers (and players) should consider.

区块链游戏除了让游戏设计师多了许多恩赐和新玩具之外，区块链游戏开发者（和玩家）也应该考虑一些严重的、影响实现的效果。

#### The players own their&nbsp;data

#### 玩家拥有他们的数据

Since player data for blockchain games is stored on a blockchain, it's public. This means that any other game can access and use that data. Even game competitors.

由于区块链游戏的玩家数据存储在区块链中，因此它是公开的。这意味着任何其他游戏都可以访问和使用该数据。即使是游戏竞争者。

Much like the physical world, you can't prevent other games from using game artifacts and assets. Just as you can take pieces from a Go game and use them on a chessboard to play checkers, you could also take game assets from one blockchain game and use them in another game.

与物理世界非常相似，您无法阻止其他游戏使用游戏装备和资产。就像你可以从围棋中取出棋子，用它们在棋盘上下棋一样，你也可以从一个区块链游戏中获取游戏资产并在另一个游戏中使用它们。

#### We can't control how players buy or sell game&nbsp;assets

#### 我们无法控制玩家如何购买或出售游戏资产

Players can purchase game assets directly from other players instead of through in-game stores. Players could also get game assets from an escrow service or in bulk from a bad actor who managed to exploit your smart contract. This means that game developers cannot rely on building business models around marketplace fees, and they cannot prevent players from reselling items.

玩家可以直接从其他玩家购买游戏资产，而不是通过游戏内商店购买。玩家还可以从第三方托管服务中获得游戏资产，或从一个设法利用你的智能合约的黑客身上获得游戏资产。这意味着游戏开发者不能依赖于围绕市场费用建立商业模式，并且他们无法阻止玩家转售商品。

It's like the used game business, but for all of your blockchain assets. Not just physical discs.

这就像二手游戏业务，但这次是对所有区块链资产。而不只是物理光盘。

#### Cryptocurrency is not the same as Hard&nbsp;Currency

#### 加密货币不是硬通货

Making your own cryptocurrency does not equate to making your own in-game, hard currency. Players own their own cryptocurrency tokens, so they don't necessarily have to make transactions with in-game currencies.

制作自己的加密货币并不等同于制作自己的游戏内硬币。玩家拥有自己的加密货币通证，因此他们不必一定要使用游戏内货币进行交易。

They're free to buy any assets on the open market using other currencies like Bitcoin instead of in-game "diamonds". Even worse, this means that the value of "hard currencies" will likely be determined by the exchange markets, not game economists.

他们可以使用比特币等其他货币在公开市场上自由购买任何资产，而不是用游戏中的“钻石”。更糟糕的是，这意味着“硬通货”的价值很可能由交易所市场决定，而非游戏经济。

### This is only the beginning

### 这仅仅是个开始

There are an incredible number of emerging use-cases and constraints that we are identifying as we dig deeper into designing blockchain games, but we hope that this provides a rough introduction to what we think is possible.

随着我们对区块链游戏的深入研究，我们发现大量新兴的用例和限制，但我们希望这能粗略地介绍一下我们认为可行的方法
