this is decentraland a virtual world that owned by its users.

这是 decentraland, 一个完全由用户拥有的虚拟世界。

and people are paying thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency for the chance to create a new virtual life online. and maybe even make a profit.

人们正在支付数千美元的虚拟货币，以便有机会创建新的在线虚拟生活。甚至还可以从中赚钱。

I'm not selling it until it's worth at least $10 million.

我不会卖，直到它至少值 1000 万美元。

they're the riskiest investments in the whole world.

它们是全世界风险最高的投资。

so will it be a virtual paradise? or a crypto property bubble?

它会成为虚拟世界的天堂？还是加密资产泡沫？

In Decentraland users can build whatever they can imageine on plots of virtual land.

在 Decentraland，用户可以在虚拟土地上构建他们可以想象的任何东西。

the world has been set up by Argentinian developers. And its first city is made up of 90000 parcels of land 10m by 10m.

这个虚拟世界是由阿根廷开发者创建的。它的第一个城市由 9 万块 10 米乘 10 米的土地组成。

At auction people paid more than $28 million for plots making it the largest ever sale of virtual land. Sam Clare was one of those who paid for a plot.

在拍卖中，人们为虚拟土地支付了超过 2800 万美元，使其成为有史以来最大的虚拟土地销售额。Sam Clare 也是为土地付费的其中之一。

I'd watched a film about virtual reality and I like the idea of owning virtual land. I also wanted a platform where I can go and mess around and play about with virtual reality. Sam's plot is in the north-west of the city and cost around $900.

我看了一部关于虚拟现实的电影，我喜欢拥有虚拟土地的想法。我想要一个平台，在那里我可以在虚拟现实中游玩。Sam 的地块位于城市的西北部，花费约 900 美元。

This literally popped up, and it's near this area that a few of my friends are in and a few of my friends might actually get in.

这个突然出现，我的一些朋友在这个区域附近，我的一些朋友可能会真正进入。

So you can all hang out in virtual reality?

那么你们都可以在虚拟现实中闲逛吗？

- Basically yeah.

- 基本上是的。

It'll be pretty much exactly the same as Facebook. Except you'll be able to hear and see each other in VR. So a bit more of a real experience. As long as we've got the internet. Stick our headsets on. And I'll be able to have friends come round my house in Decentraland. Or I can go to their house for a virtual cup of tea.

它与 Facebook 几乎完全一样。除了你能够在 VR 中听到和看到对方。所以更多的是一种真实的体验。只要我们有互联网，并戴上头盔。我将能够让朋友来到我 Decentraland 的家里。或者我可以去他们的房子里喝一杯虚拟茶。

The record price for a square of land os far is $180,000. Paid for a plot near the city's central plaza where virtual visitors first arrive. That's made people who bought land early on question just how much it might be worth now.

一块广场土地的创纪录价格是 180,000 美元。一个玩家首先出现的城市中央广场附近。这使得那些早期购买土地的人质疑现在土地的价值。

How high would the price have to get for you to sell that land? I'm not selling it until it's worth at least $10 million.

这块土地你卖多高价格？我不卖它，直到它至少值 1000 万美元。

- 10 million?

- 千万？

Yeah.

是的。

Woah, someone's paid $10,000.

哇，有人支付了 10,000 美元。

Sam shows me plots that are being listed for re-sale for six figure sums. Purchases are made in a cryptocurrency called MANA. When I met Sam one MANA was just over 10 cents.

Sam 给我看了一些正在挂牌出售的地块，价格为 6 位数。购买是用称为 MANA 的加密货币。当我遇到 Sam 时， MANA 价格刚刚超过 10 美分。

This one here, for example, is eight million MANA. Which is over $800,000.

例如，这里，要 800 万 MANA，超过 800,000 美元。

- 800,000?

- 800,000?

That's nearly a million dollars.

差不多有一百万美元。

- A million dollars?

- 一百万美元？

- But it doesn't exist?

- 但是目前它还不存在？

It does here, and it will do in about a year I believe.

它确实存在，我相信它将在大约一年内完成。

But the amount of money people are investing doesn't mean the world will be a success.

但是有很多人投资并不意味着虚拟世界将取得成功。

What matters really is will it be a good game that people want to play. They've got some talented people involved and they are gamers themselves. I'm sure that they won't try to create something bad. And it should at least be half decent. But we'll see if it really captures the imagination. If people who do not give a hoot about blockchains want to play the game. That will be the measure of whether this has been a success.

真正重要的是它会不会是一款人们想玩的好游戏。有一些天才加入此项目，而且他们自己也是游戏玩家。我相信他们不会想要创造一个不好的世界。它至少应该有一半是很好的。但我们会看到它是否真的抓住了想象力。那些对区块链不感兴趣的人想不想玩这个游戏，这是衡量游戏是否成功的关键。

To try and attract visitors there are plans to build themed neighbourhoods. Thing like Festival Land, Vegas City and even a university. They're currently being built up by virtual artists. But the creators are giving BBC Trending a sneak peek of what the city will look like when it launches.

为了吸引游客，他们计划建立主题社区。虚拟艺术家正在创建如同 Festival Land (购物中心）、拉斯维加斯城甚至大学一样的社区。创建者们给了 BBC 趋势一个前期预览，看看这个城市在启动时会是什么样子。

Right, woah.

对，哇。

I seem to be on some sort of dancefloor. I can hear music. It's very colourful. I'm sort of in an outdoor club. Woah, and now we're moving through the trees. It's very surreal, beacause there are different elements all mish-mashed together. So there seems to be a zombie out in the distance. Oh gosh, he's coming right at me! He's scary! It's a whole different world in thers. It's all colourful, It's like being in some sort of cartoon land. And it fells huge!

我好像在某个舞池里。我能听到音乐。它非常丰富多彩。我可以说是在一个户外会所。哇，现在我们正在穿过树林。这是非常超现实的，因为有很多不同的元素混合在一起。远处似乎有一个僵尸。哦，天哪，他正朝我走来！他很可怕！这是一个完全不同的世界。这一切都是丰富多彩的，就像在卡通片中。让人感觉非常广阔！

So that the world will load properly on VR headsets and desktop browsers. developers are using these blocky,retro-looking graphics to build bu their land. And unlike other virtual worlds once you've built it, no one can knock it down.

虚拟世界可以在 VR 和桌面浏览器上加载显示。开发人员正在使用这些块状、复古的图形来构建自己的土地。与其他虚拟世界不同，一旦建立，没人能把它“打倒”。

In other virtual worlds it's usually operated by a central company, And all the land, all the content resides in their servers. So users have the risk that if the company goes out of business or if they decide to change the rules. Users are at risk of losing all the content and all the creations that they have built.

在其他虚拟世界中，它通常由中心化的公司运营，而且所有的土地，所有内容都驻留在他们的服务器中。因此，如果公司破产或决定更改规则，用户就将面临风险。用户有可能丢失他们构建的所有创作内容。

The developers plan to eventually withdraw from the platform and leave the running of Decentraland to the plot owners. So could it be overrun by undesirable content?

开发商计划最终退出平台并将 Decentraland 的运行留给土地所有者。那么它可能会充满不受欢迎的内容吗？

They want to make a world where you're completely free to do whatever you want with no central control. No authority, completely decentralised. That has the obvious hazard of trolls and griefers who come along and mess up your game. if you don't have a way to deal with them, then eventually they vill turn your social platform into a trash mound.

他们想要建立一个你可以完全自由地做任何你想要的事情却没有中央控制、不用授权、完全去中心化的世界。这有明显的风险，游戏做恶者会出现并搞砸游戏。如果你没有办法处理它们，那么最终它们会将你的社交平台变成垃圾堆。

The content that is uploaded by users cannot be removed by anyone. Not even ourselves or a government. However people get the chance to see certaion content and filter out others. So ultimately there will be filters that will be set up by the community.

任何人都无法删除用户上传的内容。即使我们自己或政府。然而，人们可以看到一些内容并过滤掉其他内容。最终社区将建立内容过滤器。

The plan is for users to spend MANA on goods and experiences in the world when it's all built.

该计划让用户在全部建成时将 MANA 用于购买虚拟世界上的商品和体验。

Right now we've got an economy of around a couple of tens of millions of dollars and we hope to expand that to billions at least.

现在我们已经拥有大约几千万美元的经济规模，我们希望至少将其扩大到数十亿美元。

Sam's optimistic that there will be enough visitors for his virtual plot of land to trun a real profit. I'm planning on building a virtual reality art gallery I have a lot of friends that are artists. And I'd like to set up a system where they can showcase their art. Someone can come along, buy that art. Then maybe I get a cut, maybe Decentraland get a cut and they get their cut of course.

Sam 乐观地认为，他的虚拟土地将有足够的游客来获得真正的利润。我打算建立一个虚拟现实艺术画廊我有很多朋友都是艺术家。我想建立一个可以展示他们艺术的系统。有人可以过来购买艺术品。然后也许我会得到点利润，也许当然 Decentraland 也能得到利润。

Cryptocurrency based investments have proved to be extremely volatile. So should the advice be buyer beware? All of this could go to zero. They're the riskiest investments in the whole world. I would think that the best way to think if it is more like a kickstarter or something Where you're not buying a product. But you're throwing money at someone's idea because you really want it to happen.

事实证明，基于加密货币的投资极不稳定。那么建议买家要小心吗？所有这一切都可能归零。它们是全世界风险最高的投资。我认为最好的方式是把它当成类似 kickstarter 的众筹或者你并不是在买产品，而是真的为实现别人的想法而投钱。
